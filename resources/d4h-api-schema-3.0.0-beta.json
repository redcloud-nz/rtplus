{"openapi":"3.0.0","info":{"title":"Team Manager API","version":"3.0.0-beta","contact":{"name":"D4H Support","url":"https://help.d4h.com/","email":"help@d4h.com"},"description":"# Introduction\n\nWelcome to the D4H Team Manager REST API, a RESTful API that allows you to access Team Manager data and services. Our API is designed to enable seamless integration with your own applications, websites, and other tools.\n\nWith the REST API, you can perform most of the activities available from the Team Manager application, such as managing personel, equipment, exercises, updating their data, etc.\n\n**Notice: the D4H Team Manager REST API is not yet feature complete, future updates will increase functionality but please let us know if something you need is missing and we can try to prioritise it**\n\n## Getting Authenticated\n\nD4H Team Manager's API uses token-based authentication. There are two types of tokens:\n\n- **Personal Access Tokens**. These are used when developing an integration for yourself or for your organization. They have the convenience of being long-lived tokens, and they can be easily generated from the Unified Accounts web UI. Personal Access Tokens should only be used in applications that don't require the ability to authenticate multiple users. If your application needs to be able to support multiple users, then your application should use OAuth to obtain Standard UA Tokens.\n- **Standard UA Access Tokens**. These tokens are issued by D4H Unified Accounts after a successful user login. By implementing an OAuth-compatible login \"dance\", your application can enable its users to log in using their credentials and securely obtain an Access Token which then can be used to invoke the D4H API. Please contact our [help desk](mailto:help@d4h.com) if you are planning to build an application that falls under this category.\n\nAll token types are accepted by the REST API and should be provided in the HTTP request Authorization header:\n\n```text\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\n```\n\n### Generating a Personal Access Token\n\nYour account must be migrated to Unified Accounts authentication to be able to use the Personal Access Tokens. Also, your Team or Organisation must enable Personal Access Tokens in their settings under _API Access_.\n\nThese can be created under _Manage Personal Access Tokens_:\n\n![The \"Manage Tokens\" Page in D4H Unified Accounts](public/docs/screenshot-my-account.jpg)\n\n1. In the page you can manage existing tokens or create a new one under the “Create Token” link.\n\n2. Make sure “Team Manager” is checked under the “Products access” section so you’re able to use these tokens in the D4H Team Manager REST API.\n\nFinally, after pressing “Next”, the token will be displayed. The token is not saved by D4H, so lost tokens are not recoverable.\n\nThe JWT token should then be used on the HTTP Request Authorization headers.\n\nPlease contact D4H support if you have any problems accessing or activating your Unified Account.\n\n## Making Requests\n\nIf you are completely unfamiliar with making REST API requests, a good first step would be trying\nsome simple requests using a terminal / command-line application called `curl`. This is installed by\ndefault on newer MacOs and Windows versions, but can be installed manually on older ones.\n\n### Your First Request\n\nAfter getting an access token of some kind, open your terminal / command line and try the following command (after\nmodifying it to replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your token):\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\" -o d4h-api-whoami-response.json https://api.team-manager.us.d4h.com/v3/whoami\n```\n\nThis will make a `GET` request to the `whoami` endpoint, which if successful will return a JSON\nresponse similar to that shown [here](#tag/Accounts-Credentials/paths/~1v3~1whoami/get). This will\nbe stored in `d4h-api-whoami-response.json` in the directory from which the command is run.\n\n### Request Contexts\n\nWithin the `whoami` response, you will find arrays of `members` and `officers` objects. Each of\nthese essentially represents a team-membership or organisation-officership which your token allows requests to be performed as.\n\nEach member or officer object will have an `owner` object within, this being a representation the team or organisation itself. Each `owner` will have an `id`, and this is their _context-identifier_.\n\nHere is a part of an example response from `whoami`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"members\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"owner\": \n      {\n        \"resourceType\": \"Team\",\n        \"id\": 600,\n        \"title\": \"Team Y\",\n      },\n      \"name\": \"Member X\",\n      \"hasAccess\": true,\n      \"resourceType\": \"Member\",\n    },\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn the Team Manager API most requests are made within a specific _context_, this can be thought of\nthe point-of-view from which a request is made. A request's context is included in the URL.\nBased on the above example, the _context_ is `team` and the _context-identifier_  is `600`. Hence, an example request\nurl would be `https://api.team-manager.us.d4h.com/v3/team/600/whiteboard`.\n\nThe two contexts that would apply for most\nusers are `team` and `organisation`, and these would be followed in the URL by the id of the team or\norganisation.\n\nSee the [General URL Structure](#section/Introduction/General-URL-Structure) for further information on contexts and what each part of the URL means.\n\n### Creating Data\n\nThe following command is slightly more complex:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\" -d \"{ \\\"text\\\": \\\"I wrote this via the API\\\", \\\"important\\\": true }\" -o d4h-api-post-response.json https://api.team-manager.us.d4h.com/v3/YOUR_CONTEXT/YOUR_CONTEXT_ID_FROM_WHOAMI/whiteboard\n```\n\nIt will make a `POST` type request, which is usually used for the _creation_ of data. It will use the JSON\nyou provide via the `-d` flag in the command. The API will take whatever is after `-d` and try to\nuse it to create a resource. Your ability to create resources will be determined by your\npermissions, which are viewable in the data returned from the `whoami` request.\n\nThis command should create a whiteboard note (if you have that module turned on), that is marked as\nimportant and has the text contained in the JSON.\n\n### Alternative API clients\n\nIf you are not comfortable with the command line, or just want making requests to be more\nconvenient, there are many (many) varied GUI-based REST API clients. Some examples at\nthe time of writing:\n\n- [Bruno](https://docs.usebruno.com/)\n- [Httpie](https://httpie.io/desktop)\n- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)\n- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)\n\n## General URL Structure\n\nConsider the following example URL template:\n\n```text\n[verb] https://api.team-manager.us.d4h.com/[version]/[context]/[context-identifier]/[resource]/[resource-identifier]?[query-params]\n```\n\nAn example would be:\n\n```text\nGET https://api.team-manager.us.d4h.com/v3/team/1/incidents/234?size=100&search=angry%20clown\n```\n\nAs a general rule, looking to the verb, the URL should indicate what the API endpoint does.\n\n- `version` should be increased on breaking changes\n- `context` represents the context the request is being made under, currently only `team` or `organisations`\n  - `context-identifier` represents an unique identifier for the context\n- `resource` represents the entity domain relative to the context\n  - `resource-identifier` represents an unique identifier for the resource\n- `query-params` represent contextual data attributes that don't change the resource domain.\n  - They can be used for:\n    - search\n    - pagination / ordering / sorting\n    - a team-context request wishing to include/exclude organisation-context resources from results\n    - etc...\n\n### Contexts\n\nContexts are not a resource, but a point-of-view from which a request is made. There is an implicit `team`-`organisation` relationship that is not obvious from the url, but should be borne in mind. A `team` generally has access to its own data, but also _some_ data of its parent `organisation`. An `organisation` has access to its own data, but also _some_ of its multiple sub-`team`s. The data shared can vary by `resource`-type.\n\nTherefore, the `team` context in a request means: the data owned by this team and that implicitly shared by its associated `organisation` if any.\n\nCorrespondingly, the `organisation` context in a request means: the data owned by this organisation and that which is implicitly shared by its associated `team`s.\n\n#### Context-Entity Endpoints\n\nSince `team` and `organisation` are used in the URL structure to designate the context, their plural form can appear again in the same URL to request data about the entities themselves.\n\n- `/v3/team/123/teams/123` - returning data about the team `123`\n- `/v3/team/123/teams/456` - returning data about a sibling team `456`\n- `/v3/team/123/organisations/789` - returning data about a team's parent organisation\n- `/v3/organisation/789/organisations/789` - returning data about the organisation itself\n- `/v3/organisation/789/teams/123` - returning data about one of the organisation's child teams\n\nAs for any other endpoint, the data returned will be as from the point-of-view specified by the context.\n\n#### Requesting or filtering data from multiple contexts\n\nIt may be desirable to retrieve resources from multiple contexts in one request, or exclude data from the\nimplicit team/organisation relationship. In these cases specific query parameters (`exclude_org_data`, `exclude_teams_data`)\nare to be used as modifiers to indicate intent\n\n- `/v3/team/123/equipment-brands` - team-owned and org-owned\n- `/v3/team/123/equipment-brands?exclude_org_data=true` - team-owned only\n- `/v3/organisation/123/equipment-brands` org-owned and sub-team-owned\n- `/v3/organisation/123/equipment-brands?exclude_teams_data=true` org-owned only\n\nThese modifiers should be available on every appropriate `GET` route and also apply\nto functional `GET` endpoints\n\n\"Sibling\" teams' data must be requested separately\n\n## Resource Ownership\n\nIn responses resource ownership is represented\nas an `owner` object which includes the owner id and its resource type.\n\n```json\n{\n \"owner\": {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"resourceType\": \"Team\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Resource / Entity Bundles\n\n\"Bundling\" varies between resource types. The existing bundles based around string names is deprecated, and the goal is to eventually move all bundles over to resource-bundle endpoint.\nBut, in the meantime, bundle string properties will be named `deprecatedBundle`, reserving the `bundle` / `resourceBundle` property name for\na resource-bundle object in the future. `deprecated` should be included in both the payload and response keys.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"bundle\": {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"resourceType\": \"ResourceBundle\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Member Addresses\n\nThe members endpoints currently return and accept a `deprecatedAddress` string to represent a member's address. This is to allow us to add an `address` object in the future\nwith individual `street`, `postcode`, etc properties without breaking backwards-compatability.\n\n## Enums\n\nEnums are always case-sensitive strings. Specifically:\n\n- Enums in query parameters, payloads, and responses are always in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.\n- Context enums in urls (and urls in general) are always in `kebab-case`.\n- Resource type enums anywhere are always in `PascalCase`.\n\nExplanations for their meaning and use should be provided in either the validation description, or in a preface paragraph for the endpoint as a whole\n\n## Validation\n\nRequest parameters, queries and payloads will be validated against strict schemas as per the API endpoint reference below. Validation failure will generate meaningful 400 HTTP errors that will include all violations when possible.\n\nSupplying additional keys not defined in an endpoint schema is forbidden and will also result in 400 errors.\n\n### Important Remarks\n\n#### Sanitization\n\nStrings are not to be sanitized beyond what is needed for the API itself. It is up to the client to sanitize api responses for its own uses.\n\n#### Date Format\n\nDates should be on the wire as ISO 8601 strings (`\"1975-08-19T23:15:30.000Z\"`). Team Manager stores all date-times as UTC so received\ndate-times will be saved as that, and responses will be returned as UTC ISO 8601 strings.\n\n#### Value Conversion\n\nThe API will do no conversion of values, which will be stored in the lowest precision required using the metric system. This includes currency, which will be stored in the lowest denomination. It's up to clients to use the context's settings to determine how to display each value.\n\n#### Location data\n\nResponses will format location data as per the GeoJSON format for \"Point\" (see spec [here](https://geojson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#point))\n\n```json\n{\n  \"location\": {\n    \"type\": \"Point\",\n    \"coordinates\": [0.0, 0.0]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nD4H Team Manager REST API uses a common data contract for returnings error (HTTP 4xx and 5xx) responses - `statusCode` represents the HTTP code. `code` is a machine readable error. `message` is a user focused error message. An optional `data` property contains additional details, for example validation errors.\n\n### Specific Errors\n\n#### HTTP 429\n\n[429 http status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429)\n\nIf you receive this error when making requests it means you've hit the rate limit and need to reduce the frequency of your requests in future.\nIf you have a use case requiring an increased limit, please contact support.\n","x-logo":{"url":"public/img/d4h-logo-transparent.png","altText":"D4H
