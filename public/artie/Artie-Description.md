# Artie Mascot Style Guide


## Overall Aesthetic
A clean, 2D vector illustration style with clear outlines and simple shading. The character should appear friendly, competent, and modern.


## Character & Pose:

- Artie is a human character with realistic, though slightly simplified, proportions.

- Poses should be expressive and clearly communicate the intended state or action (e.g., success, error, welcome).


## Uniform:

- Color: The primary color is a vibrant, solid red.

- Fit: The uniform is form-fitting and functional, not baggy.


# Details

- Features yellow and silver/grey reflective stripes on the arms and torso.

- Includes dark grey or black reinforced patches on the knees and elbows.

- Has a high collar.


# Gear & Accessories:

- Helmet: A modern, orange technical rescue helmet with a short brim. It has black accents and, most importantly, a pair of goggles resting on the front.

- Boots: Sturdy, solid black, lace-up work boots.


# Artistic Execution:

- Linework: Consistent, solid black outlines define the character's shapes.

- Shading: Uses simple "cel-shading" (solid blocks of darker color) to create depth, avoiding complex gradients.

- Background: Always a plain, solid white background for easy integration into your website.


# Purpose

Using this guide should help us maintain a consistent and professional look for Artie in all future images.
